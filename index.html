   <br>

  Div is a block level element and span is inline element<br>

      Div always start on the new line,and it will take whole width of the
      screen and span takes the space required fir it, it does not occupy
      unneccesary width
 

    <div>Hi,Good evening</div>
    <span>How Are you guys? </span><span>Hope you are doing good </span></br> <br>

   2.<strong>DIFF BETWEEN CLAAS & ID</strong>
</br>
   Ids and class are selectors and are used to give name to element,using id
    and class we can target a particular or multiple element. </br>
    Ids are unique and
    classes are not,we can apply multiple classes to any element but we cannot
    apply same value of any id to different element. In one file there should be
    just one id.</br>
     we denote classes with dot and Ids with slash.
    <div class="class classes class1"></div>
    <span class="class classes class1"></span>
