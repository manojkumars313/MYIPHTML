      <h1>CSS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS DAY 1</h1>

      <h3>1.Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet?</h3>
      <strong>external style sheet</strong> With an external style sheet, you
      can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each
      HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside
      the <link /> element, inside the head section.<br />

      <strong>internal style sheet</strong>An internal style sheet may be used
      if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined
      inside the <strong>style</strong> element, inside the head section.<br />

      <strong>inline style sheet</strong> An inline style may be used to apply a
      unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style
      attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS
      property.<br />

      <h3>2.What is css box model?</h3>
      In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML
      element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
      content. The image below illustrates the box model.

      <h3>3.What is the difference between padding and margin?</h3>
      <strong>Padding</strong> Padding is used to create space around an
      element's content, inside of any defined borders.
      <br />
      <strong>Margin</strong> The CSS margin properties are used to create space
      around elements, outside of any defined borders.

      <h3>4.Difference between flex row and column</h3>
      <strong>flex-row</strong> The column value stacks the flex items
      vertically (from top to bottom).<br />
      <strong>flex-column</strong> The row value stacks the flex items
      horizontally (from left to right).

      <h3>5.Justify-content allows you to do what?</h3>
      The justify-content property is used to align the flex items.<br />
      The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the
      container (this is default).<br />
      The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container<br />
      The space-between value displays the flex items with space between the
      lines.

      <h3>6.Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h3>
      <strong>Relative</strong>An element with position: relative; is positioned
      relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left
      properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted
      away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit
      into any gap left by the element.<br />
      <strong>Absolute</strong> An element with position: absolute; is
      positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
      positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute
      positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body,
      and moves along with page scrolling.

      <h3>7.What is the z-index in CSS?</h3>
      When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.<br />

      The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which
      element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).<br />

      An element can have a positive or negative stack order:
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
